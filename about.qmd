About this site

My name is Luis Cerrillos, I was born and raised in Pomona, CA. I spent a lot of my youth in the garage working on classic cars and dirt bikes. I found a deep passion for all things mechanics. I currently am finishing up my Marine Science degree at California State University of Monterey Bay. I currently am working on a project utilizing SCUBA and stereo-video to study the latitudinal changes of fish species richness/composition/density/etc.
